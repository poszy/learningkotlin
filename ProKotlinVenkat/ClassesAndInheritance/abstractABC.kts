/**

 *
 *     The properties defined within interfaces donâ€™t have backing fields; they have to rely on abstract methods to get properties from implementing classes. On the other hand, properties within abstract classes can use backing fields.
 *
 *     You may implement multiple interfaces but can extend from at most one class, abstract or not.
 * If you want to reuse state between multiple classes, then an abstract class is a good choice. You can implement the common state in the abstract class and have implementing classes override the methods, while reusing the state provided by the abstract class.
 *
 * If you want multiple classes to abide by one or more contracts or specifications, but you want those classes to choose their own implementations, then interfaces are the better choice. If you choose this route, you may also move some common methods into the interfaces, while still letting the implementing classes choose how they implement the state.
