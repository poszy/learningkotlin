// there are two types of tuples
// Pair and Tripple. unlike other languages that allow the creation of tuples bigger than 2 or 3, kotlin limits to these two.

println(Pair("one/","two")) // can create a pair of objects with the constructor
println(mapOf("tom" to "cat", "jerry" to "mouse")) // this is just the way to create a pair using a map. to() creates the mapping from whats on the left ot whats on the right
